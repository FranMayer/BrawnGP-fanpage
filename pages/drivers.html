            <p>We are going to review the lives of our two drivers who led the BrawnGP team to glory. We will also review the history of Ross Brawn, the founder of the team.</p>

            <section class="Jenson_card">
                    <h3>Jenson Button</h3>
                    <img src="/multi/Button.jpg" alt="Jenson Button">
                    <p>Jenson joined Brawn GP in 2009 after the team was formed following Honda's sale. His role was crucial to the team’s success, as he went on to win the Drivers' Championship that same year. Button stood out for his ability to adapt to changing race conditions, his smooth and efficient driving style, and his talent for extracting maximum performance from the car, especially in wet conditions. His victory in the 2009 championship was a milestone in his career and in Brawn GP's history, proving that even with a newly-formed team, an experienced driver can dominate the season and claim the title in impressive fashion.</p>

            <section class="Rubens_card">
                <h3>Rubens Barrichello</h3>
                <img src="/multi/Rubens.jpg" alt="Rubens Barrichello">
                <p>The Brazilian driver with vast experience, joined Brawn GP in 2009 after spending many years at Ferrari. Although Button was the main protagonist in the battle for the championship, Barrichello played a key role in the team’s development and competitiveness. With consistent performances in races and a meticulous technical approach, Barrichello helped maximize the car's potential on several occasions. His experience and technical knowledge were vital to the car’s design and race strategies, and although he didn’t win the Drivers' Championship, his collaboration with Brawn GP and his performance that season are still highly respected in Formula 1.</p>
